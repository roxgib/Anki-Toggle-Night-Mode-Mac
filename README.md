# Anki-Toggle-Night-Mode-Mac
Scripts to programatically change Anki's night mode on MacOS

I use these scripts in Keyboard Maestro since it already configures a number of other contextual settings for me, but you can easily rewrite them for your own purposes. 
Make sure to change USER to your user directory in the file path.
Anki needs to be closed and reopened for the change to take effect.
